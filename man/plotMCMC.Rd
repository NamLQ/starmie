\usage{
plotMCMC(struct_list, make_plot = TRUE, use_logL = TRUE, facet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{struct_list}{a list \code{\link{struct}} objects}

\item{make_plot}{logical print resulting plot default TRUE}

\item{use_logL}{logical plot log-likelihood (TRUE) or admixture coeffecient}

\item{facet}{logical facet by K default TRUE}
}
\description{
Plot non-burn MCMC iterations of STRUCTURE for checking convergence.
If make_plot is set to FALSE a data.frame is returned containing the log likelihood
and alpha values over different K and runs and not plot is printed to the device.
